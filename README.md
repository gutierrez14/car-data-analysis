# Car Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project explores what factors influence a carâ€™s resale value, fuel efficiency, and overall performance using a real-world automotive dataset. I created it as a way to apply what I'm learning about Python, data analysis, and visualization, and to better understand how data can tell a story in the automotive space. 

## Questions Explored
1. What manufacturers have the highest resale value?
2. What features are most correlated with resale value?
3. What factors influence performance (Power Performance Factor)?
4. Do heavier cars tend to have more horsepower?
5. Which manufacturers offer the best fuel efficiency?
6. Which cars balance fuel efficiency and resale value best?

## Data
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Rows:** 156 vehicles
- **Columns:** Manufacturer, Model, Engine Size, Horsepower, Price, Fuel Efficiency, Resale Value, etc.
- **Target Features:** Resale Value, Fuel Efficiency, Power Performance Factor

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook (on VSCode)
- GitHub for version control

## Key Insights
- **Porsche** has the highest resale value by a significant margin, followed by Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
- Resale value is most strongly influenced by price, horsepower, and Power Performance Factor.
- Power Performance Factor increases with horsepower and engine size.
- Heavier cars tend to have more horsepower.
- Saturn, Chevrolet, and Hyundai lead in fuel efficiency, while performance brands trade fuel economy for power.
- A few vehicles manage to balance high fuel efficiency and resale value, ideal for long-term value.

##  About Me
I'm a recent Computer Science graduate lookin to break into data analytics. I am wokring gaining experience trough online resouces and projects like this one that allow me to explore how data connects to real-world industries, especially automotive performance and technology. I created this project to show my curiosity, willingness to learn, and commitment to growing in this field.
